# BIGBIOCL
Software for efficient analysis of biological large datasets. As an example, BIGBIOCL can be used with DNA methylation data for the identification of drivers of tumors.
  
A scientific publication about this reaserch will be provided later on.
  
The description of the project, of our experiments, and of the software is available in the [wiki section](https://github.com/fcproj/BIGBIOCL/wiki).
  
Directories contain:
* __Experiments__: results of our experiments
* __Software__: the JAVA code to run standalone applications or submit Spark Jobs
* __Support Files__: mapping files and other files needed to replicate our experiments, or to run new ones
