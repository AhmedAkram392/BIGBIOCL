# BIGBIOCL
Software for efficient analysis of biological large datasets. As an example, BIGBIOCL can be used with DNA methylation data for the identification of drivers of tumors.
  
The scientific publication about BIGBIOCL is availble at: "F. Celli, F. Cumbo, E. Weitschek: Classification of Large DNA Methylation Datasets for Identifying Cancer Drivers. Big Data Research, 10.1016/j.bdr.2018.02.005, 2018".
  
The description of the project, of our experiments, and of the software is available in the [wiki section](https://github.com/fcproj/BIGBIOCL/wiki).
  
Directories contain:
* __Experiments__: results of our experiments
* __Software__: the JAVA code to run standalone applications or submit Spark Jobs
* __Support Files__: mapping files and other files needed to replicate our experiments, or to run new ones
