Software for efficient analysis of biological large datasets. As an example, BIGBIOCL can be used on DNA methylation data for the identification of drivers of tumors.
  
A Scientific article of this reaserch will be provided soon.
  
The description of the project, of our experiments, and of the software to replicate or run new experiments is available in the [wiki section](https://github.com/fcproj/BIGBIOCL/wiki).
  
Directories contain:
* __Experiments__: results of our experiments
* __Software__: the JAVA code to run standalone applications or submit Spark Jobs
* __Support Files__: mapping files and other files needed to replicate our experiments, or as a guideline to run new experiments
